Configuration
=============

Dependencies
------------

Magro makes use of the PLY library for Python. PLY is an LR parser
generator and can be found at: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/

Environment
-----------

The following values should be set for Magro to work:

``MAGRO_PATH``
    This environment variable is the list of directories that Magro
    will use to find the libraries imported by the templates.
    
    This value can be set programatically from Python code through
    the ``macro.env.path`` variable:

        >>> import magro.env as env
        >>> env.path.append( '/path/to/magro/libraries' )
        >>> env.path
        ['.', '/path/to/magro/libraries']
        
    By default, this variable includes the current invocation
    path (i.e. ``'.'``)
